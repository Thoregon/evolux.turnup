##Hints for 'near' results
disclose separately results which doesn't match exactly but are near, e.g. 
- a nonstop or cheaper flight on another day 
- if you add xx to the cart you will receive a discount of yy.

Also support questions about when a condition is met 
- when is a nonstop flight 
- when is a hotel room available there?

##Proposals for tasks

e.g. query for 'invoice'
--> display unbilled deliveries

##Group queries by context
- content
- actions

##Refine query
based on current query (context)
question/answer wizzard
